## Authentication
- Authentication is handled solely by Firebase Authentication (Email/Password and optional social providers).
- Backend auth endpoints `/api/auth/login` and `/api/auth/admin-login` are disabled and return 410.
- Roles and profiles are stored in Firestore under `users/{uid}` with fields like `role`, `fullName`, `joinedAt`.

### Developer setup
1. Enable Email/Password in Firebase Console ‚Üí Authentication.
2. Create test users in Firebase Auth or register via the app.
3. Set user role in Firestore (`users/{uid}.role`) to `admin`, `community-leader`, or `resident`.
4. App login/registration uses Firebase SDK. On login, the app reads role from Firestore and enforces route access.

### Optional sync
- You may call `/api/auth/sync` after login/registration to upsert profile fields in your backend/Firestore if needed.

### Securing backend
- Protect sensitive routes by validating Firebase ID tokens from `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.
